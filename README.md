#Milestone Project 1 - Author Website

[View the live project here](https://pablo1793.github.io/mp1-author_website/)

This is my first webpage, created for my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project submission. It is a website for a fictional author named Guy Scriblin. It is designed to be responsive and accesible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for existing and potential readers alike.
