                    <p>As the prophet Kibal once said, "<strong>The rains began to fall, and humanity ran for cover.</strong>"

                    </p>
                    <p class="book-synopsis">For centuries the people of the island nations of <em>Oyldorch</em> have lived at the mercy of extreme weather conditions. Although the Sacred Texts tell of a
                        time when the skies were clear, the origins of the incessant precipitation are unknown.<br>
                        The story begins with <em>Ceann</em>, a young man from the island <em>Dochas</em>, working in the underground wheat fields alongside his friends <em>Ada</em> and <em>Triu</em>. Like
                        any other day, they find their work monotonous but important, and enjoy their time together sharing stories and gossip. But this day is different. As they are nearing the end of their
                        shift a massive earthquake shakes the island.<br>
                        Although at first they are relieved that none of the crop caves collapsed, they are horrified when they return to their village - nestled beneath the enormous cliffs of <em>Cosantoir</em>
                        - and find it buried beneath the collapsed cliffs.<br>
                        With almost everyone they've ever known lost to the calamity, the three friends decide to make their way to the island capital - the citadel <em>Sciath</em> - to inform the Island Steward
                        of what has happened.<br>
                        Thus they leave their at times boring and uncomfortable - but always familiar - lives behind them. And set out to lands foreign to them; where uncertainty and danger await them.
                        <hr>
                    </p>
                    <p>Little do they know, their odyssey will be more challenging than they thought. And they will
                        discover along the way that they possess ancient powers lost to memory which only through intense ordeal come to light.</p>

                    <p class="book-synopsis">Upon reaching their destination at the end of the previous novel only to find it in ruins, the three friends make a decision. To each take upon themselves a separate
                        task. <em>Triu</em> will remain in the valley of <em>Sciath</em> to organise a new settlement for the survivors of the disaster, with the help of the mysterious elder <em>Ciallmar</em>.
                        Who will help him understand and master his newfound powers of <em>Protection</em>.<br>
                        <em>Ada</em> will investigate the abnormal natural disasters as she believes their origin to be unnatural. She will begin her inquiry at the <em>Temple of Eagna</em> where the ancient
                        Wisdoms are said to dwell. There she will learn about her power of <em>Illusion</em>.<br>
                        And <em>Ceann</em> will travel to the central island <em>Rikkios</em> to consult with the great <em>Queen Banria</em> about what to do next. During his journey he will discover the full
                        extent of his power of <em>Gravitation</em>.<br>
                        In addition to our three protagonists, we will follow the solitary wanderer <em>Tubaiste</em> and his mysterious plan to bring the ancient Prophecies of Calamity to fruition. Thinking
                        only he has inherited from the powers of antiquity, he will seek to bring all of humanity to its knees before him using his power of <em>Domination</em>.<br>
                        As our heroes stray from the path they thought they would follow, the world grows larger before them. Exciting and belittling, as exhilirating as is it dangerous. They can't know for certain
                        what awaits them; but they can be sure they will have changed by their next meeting.

                    <p>Though the three friends are driven by purpose in their respective missions, they will find their paths burdensome. And discover what they took for granted when they were together.</p>

                    <p class="book-synopsis">At the start of the third novel we follow <em>Ceann</em> returning to <em>Sciath</em> alongside the General <em>Laidir</em> and a battallion of the Queen's Elites, ready to
                        escort <em>Triu</em> and the survivors back to the safety of <em>Rikkios</em>.<br>
                        <em>Tubaiste</em> has infiltrated the settlement of <em>New Sciath</em> under the guise of a priest warning of forthcoming doom much worse than what humanity has experienced
                        thus far. In reality he is poisoning the minds of the weak-willed and discontent, gaining an ever larger following.<br>
                        Meanwhile, <em>Ada</em> returns from her journey in the previous novel with a warning of her own: the previous natural disasters are only the beginning of a more onerous
                        course of events.<br>
                        Reunited once more, the three friends will work together to get to the bottom of the increasing conflict among the surviving islanders and face their hitherto unknown foes. They hope to unravel
                        these mysteries soon; before any more lives are lost in vain.<br>
                        Will our heroes prevail in saving the lives of the innocent? Or will <em>Tubaiste</em> and his mysterious masters manage to spread dread and destruction throughout <em>Oyldorch</em>?
